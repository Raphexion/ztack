## Basic syntax

Make sure to understand the difference between `!T` and `?T`.
The first is used to indicate that the operation holds and `error union type`,
which means it is either at type T or an error.

Whereas, `?T` is an optional type, meaning it can hold either a value or null.

It is somewhat similar to Either and Maybe in Haskell.
